In this project we will be doing a business analysis of albums and tracks sold by different artists and different profit per genre to find which three artists are most recommended to buy to sell at the record store in Chinook. We will walk through who has the most track sales, and look at what genres tehy belong to as well. We will use the schema diagram to see how the tables all relate to help with our JOIN statements to combine information from different tables to get our conclusion.
