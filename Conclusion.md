<h3>Closing Analysis  <h6></h6>
  
  
After a meticulous analysis of the Chinook Music Stores sales data, it is evident that to enhance the stores music collection strategically based on track sales,  
1. Minha Historia by Chico Buarque
2. Acustico by Titas
3. Greatest Kiss by Kiss
  
  
This will not only bring the top 3 artist with the top selling track sales but this also brings variety to the music store hitting 3 different genres, Rock, latin and Alternative & Punk. This selection will not only cater to customer preferences but capitalizes on proven track records, ensuring a more profitabe music catalog.
